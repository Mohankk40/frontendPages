        <h3>Writings and legacy</h3>
        <p>While on campaign between 170 and 180, Marcus 
          wrote his Meditations in Greek as a source for
           his own guidance and self-improvement. The 
           original title of this work, if it had one, is 
           unknown. 'Meditations' – as well as other titles 
           including 'To Himself' – were adopted later. 
           He had a logical mind, and his notes were 
           representative of Stoic philosophy and 
           spirituality. Meditations is still revered as a 
           literary monument to a government of service and 
           duty. George Long's English translation of 
           Meditations was included in Volume 2 of the 
           Harvard Classics. According to Hays, the book 
           was a favourite of Christina of Sweden, Frederick 
           the Great, John Stuart Mill, Matthew Arnold, and 
           Goethe, and is admired by modern figures such as 
           Wen Jiabao and Bill Clinton. It has been 
           considered by many commentators to be one of the 
           greatest works of philosophy. Meditations 
           sold 16,000 copies in 2012. In 2019, 100,000 
           copies were sold.
